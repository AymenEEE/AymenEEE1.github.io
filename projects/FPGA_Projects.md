summary: "This page shows a brief summary of my FPGA projects which includes 7-segments display, clock dividers and linear feedback shifts"

<h2>Lab 1</h2>
  <h3>Segment displays</h3>
  <p>Driving a segments display is rather simple. All we have to do is create a look up table that corresponds to the individual segments and we're all good </p>

  <p> The same process is repeated for three displays. Each display can show up to 4 bits. Note that we are displaying the binary numbers as hexadecimal on the segment displays. </p>
